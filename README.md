# Chat Application

I am creating a Complete Chat Application using PHP with MySQL & JavaScript. In this chat app, first you have to signup if you're new on the chat application. Then after successfully signing up, you will be redirected to the users area page where users like you who have signed up to this chat app will appear along with their full names, profile image, activity status. 

You can select any user to start to chat with them. You can also easily log out from the chat application by clicking on the logout button and after successful logout, you will be redirected to the login page of the chat app and your status will be offline for other signed-up users. You have to log in with your signed up email and password to enter the chatting page again.
